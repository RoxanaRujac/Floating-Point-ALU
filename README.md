# Floating-Point-ALU
This project focuses on designing and implementing a Floating-Point Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL and deploying it on an FPGA. It supports IEEE 754-based addition and multiplication, ensuring efficient floating-point operations with normalization, rounding, and exception handling.
